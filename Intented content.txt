Classification A, entity type: U is for units, M for mechs, G for planetary/campgaign/enviormental aspect, B for blocks, T for deployable turrets (hybrid of U and B entities) and I for items
Classification B, release plans: P for planned, partially complete or ready to release content, Q is for questionable, H is for something i doubt it will be implemented by myself (if at all) and R is for currently released content, and have no reason for them to be here
Classification C, limitations in terms "where can it be built": A if available in any gamemode, E for expansion content, C if campagin-exclusive, S for Sandbox-only (reffered to most drone union technology) and n/a for non-expansion G or I class entities what can mainly appear as an ore
Classification C for U or M class entities: A if it's factory can be acsessed in normal gameplay, E for expansion content, C if their factory is campagin-exclusive (but can also be placed in the editor) and S for Sandbox-only factories, spawned not from blocks, but rather other units or can be spawned only by "Enemy spawn"
Futher content is getting based off where their idea or concept originated from. And there is "Undefined" category because why not
Anything with "?" in place of it's respective classification means that its uncertain how exactly ic dould be classifed with
Stuff may be added, changed or removed if i deem that needed
