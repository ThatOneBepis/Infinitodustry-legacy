For adding custom sprites, use mindustry pallete, along infinity pallete spotted in this branch

Considering im running out of Source moddingn't stuff ideas, at one point i might shift this into source version, and that will probably end up before b-f. Mod may or may not split up, for some reason

CHANGELOG
 
 -Arc MK2, internally called "Edison"
 
 -Way to craft critter boxes, their factories are currently broken
