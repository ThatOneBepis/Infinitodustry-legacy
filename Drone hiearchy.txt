--Divinity
The allmighty. In other words: strongest of them all and many weapons, overdrive projector, healing beams, healing bursts, mining operations, reconstruction beam, all in one.
Basically, it's entire faction's leader.
Coloring role: Cyan/Lime/Orange
Fighting location: Divine Asteroid field, or anywhere where a mere mortal would place "Divine Altar"

--Ghosts
All drones are like Divinity, but with no offensive weaponry. Only rare numbers exist, most either act as frontline commanders, while some retain near Divinity, being pain in the ass to all whom dares to slay him.
Coloring role: Cyan/Lime

--Cycler
Misterious "drones", which serve differing purposes based off their design, which all share same weapon design (Divinity uses that weapon type too to an extent). Serves as "bosses", which have specific playgrounds and mechanics, while some may appear randomly.
-Mobwagon
A ship which supports raids of bases which did not expect an air assault. Most common (internally used to be named "experiment", as their implementation was in experimental fashion). May or may have different segments which spawn Angel Drones upon death.
Coloring role: Orange/Lime
Fighting location: Any, produced in "Wagoonlagoon" sector.
-Messanger
Mothership, which launches small Messy attack drones. Said drones are often used to distract enemy deffenses if they were to fire while Messanger would send it's prophecies (whatever Divinity would want to be sent to them). Hates Ion cannons, as they can dish out much damage out of nowhere. Also your to-go guy for legal advices.
Coloring role: Purple/Red
Fighting location: Any
-Mr. Genocide
Specific design, which can be explained by it's name. Try not to piss off Divinity to the point he send him to one of your outposts/bases, unless they are fully automated buildings with no troops.
Coloring role: Dark Red/Blue
Fighting location: Base-less attacks
-Havocc
Support ship what loves chaos. Has armed himself with force fields, teleportation module, and critters. Sees uprises as entertaintment, rather than a problem (as he himself solves them).
Coloring role: Brown/Cyan
Fighting location: Mount. Chaos
-Fed EX
Transport ship, which only drops units when near an enemy block of high priority (when in battle). Outside of battle, it is used for troop delivery of inter-planetary proportions.

-Pointer
Terran command tank, but it flies. And has arc cannons.
Coloring role: Lime/Purple
Fighting location: Any, produced in "NullPointerArray" sector.

--Inquisitor
Most trusted of regular drones, allowing them to equip double-egded detection system. They guard every location of interest, where Black widow and Reverse-engineered Shadow Drones which could deal too much damage what could be accepted. Yes, Sensor arrays are a thing, but no, they are not that economic for Divinity's taste.
Coloring role: Brown/Purple

--Archangel
Auxuliary drone what is capable of deffending itself from the enemy. Used where Angels would be deemed less effective (like, everywhere).

Brave drones ready to venture into core of enemy bases, using it's beam to breach holes in said enemy's defenses/infrastructure, repairing itself from any damage it may have took in the process.
Coloring role: Dark Red

--Auxiliaries
Drones what with their supportive abilities reduces chances the enemy can win, but are useless when left alone (advanced regular drones, i guess)

-Ant
Booster of bases, projects overdriving, boosting production and fire rate of turrets. Divinity and Cyclers are discussing if it should be armed with building properties too.

--Crusader
Respected among regular drones, these are used ion more heated areas of battle, as their mutlishot lasers can greatly break intruder's morale.
Coloring role: Cyan

--Shadow
Knights which decided to become more sneaky, allowing them to strike at armies without fear of dying. Aren't shadows supposed to lack fear and accept the abyss anyway?
Coloring role: Dark Red

--Regular drones
More vanilla-ish drones (including Knight and Angel), what are lowest in the hiearchy. Their role can be said by their looks. Widespread among Mindustry civilisation.

Coloring role: Lime
-Knight
Patrol drone, which guards bases. Armed with lancers to banish their foes.

-Spirit
That type of drones what heals what is damaged. A must in cases of constant raids.
Coloring role: Cyan

Mining drone what collects resources. Lacking of them is mostly going to cause early-base resource shortages.
